### PROCESS:
- Search through available databases on the city of Pittsburgh.
- Notice potential relationships between them that could result in "quantifiable data" that determines the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
- Safety, specifically of children, is essential for a great neighborhood.
- Children are often found at playgrounds and in schools, so those are the locations that should be the safest.
- Fire is dangerous for children. The farther the trash fires are from the playgrounds and schools, the better.
